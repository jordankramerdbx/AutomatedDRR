     * Rationale Reference: The rationale for the following code snippet is discussed in ISDA DRR Technical Execution Working Group on July 27' 2023.
     * Rationale: Current structure of CDM Collateral Object allows margin currency to be posted for each type of Haircut (Pre or Post). ESMA EMIR regulatory Rules does not specify the type of haircut to be considered for margin currency. This code snippet ensures and checks for both pre and post currency to be same.
