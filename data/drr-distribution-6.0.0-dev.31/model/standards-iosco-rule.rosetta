body Authority IOSCO <"The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is the international body that brings together the world's securities regulators and is recognized as the global standard setter for the securities sector. IOSCO develops, implements and promotes adherence to internationally recognized standards for securities regulation. It works intensively with the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on the global regulatory reform agenda.">

body Authority CPMI_IOSCO <"IOSCO and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) work together to enhance coordination of standard and policy development and implementation, regarding clearing, settlement and reporting arrangements including financial market infrastructures (FMIs) worldwide. FMIs, which include central counterparties (CCPs), trade repositories (TRs), central securities depositories (CSDs), securities settlement systems (SSSs), and payment systems (PSs), play an essential role in the global financial system. IOSCO and the CPMI monitor the implementation of the Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMI), which are international standards for payment systems, central securities depositories, securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories. The PFMI are designed to help ensure the safety, efficiency and resilience of these infrastructures supporting global financial markets - so their full, timely and consistent implementation is fundamental. CPMI and IOSCO members have committed to adopting the principles and responsibilities contained in the PFMI in line with the G20 expectations.">

corpus TechnicalGuidance "Harmonisation of Critical Data Elements (other than UTI and UPI)" CDE <"The G20 Leaders agreed in 2009 that all over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions should be reported to trade repositories (TRs) to further the goals of improving transparency, mitigating systemic risk and preventing market abuse.1 Aggregation of the data being reported across TRs will help authorities to obtain a comprehensive view of the OTC derivatives market and its activity. Such aggregation is feasible if the work on standardisation and harmonisation of important data elements [is] completed.2 Since November 2014, the CPMI and IOSCO working group for the harmonisation of key OTC derivatives data elements (Harmonisation Group) has worked to develop global guidance regarding the definition, format and usage of key OTC derivatives data elements reported to TRs, including the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI), the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) and other critical data elements. Technical Guidance on the Harmonisation of the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) was published in February 20173 and Technical Guidance on the Harmonisation of the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) was published in September 2017.4 The CPMI and IOSCO also published consultative reports on a first, a second and a third batch of critical data elements other than UTI and UPI in September 2015, October 2016 and June 2017, respectively">

corpus UPITechnicalGuidance "Harmonisation of the Unique Product Identifier" UPI <"This document (the Technical Guidance) provides authorities with technical guidance on a uniform global Unique Product Identifier (UPI). 1 A number of reports2 have identified OTC derivatives data elements  including the UPI  that are critical to many aspects of regulatory work. This report envisions a system under which a unique UPI code would be assigned to each distinct OTC derivative product and each UPI code would map to a set of data comprised of eference data elements with specific values that together describe the product. The collection of reference data elements and their values for each product would reside in a corresponding UPI reference data library.">
